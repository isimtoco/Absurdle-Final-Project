For my final project, I created an Absurdle, a game similar to Wordle except it keeps going until the user gets the word right.
The game will ask the user to input a 5 letter word.
If it isn’t 5 letters, it will tell the user that the word needs to be 5 letters and to enter in a 5 letter word again.
Once entered, the game will tell the user what letters are right, and if they’re in the right spot. 
This will go on until the user gets the word right. 
After the user guesses the correct word, the game will ask the user if they want to play again. 
If they do, the game will repeat. 
If they don’t, the game will end and thank the user for playing. 
One problem that I had was wondering how I was going to indicate to the user that a letter was right/wrong or a letter was in the right/wrong spot.
I wasn't sure how to change the color of text.
Because of that, I decided to print out statements that tell the user if a letter was right/wrong or a letter was in the right/wrong spot.
I also like how I added that the word the user enters has to be 5 letters.
Otherwise, it will ask the user again to enter a word.
